# GPU Rendering & Shader Framework

GPU Rendering & Shader Framework is a collection of real-time GPU shaders implemented in Metal with SwiftUI integration. The project showcases animated visual effects including fire, smoke, Voronoi patterns, lava-lamp simulations, angle-based distortions, and color-splitting effects.

The framework uses noise functions, fractal Brownian motion (FBM), multi-octave layering, and time-based UV distortions to create dynamic, interactive visual effects. Shaders are integrated into SwiftUI views with interactive controls, reusable components, and touch-responsive animations.
